      I&#39;ve been a technology enthusiast as far back as I can remember, whether it was building
      custom computers for friends, helping a local business with a website, or getting caught
      sneaking on the family computer late at night in my high school years.

      It was natural then that I progressed to learning how to operate computers in my college
      years. In college I spent spare hours learning HTML/CSS/Javascript and tinkering with the
      first smart phones - think Windows Mobile 6.1 Pocket PC.

      After a few years in the professional field, I realized I wanted to get back into programming.
      In 2016, after a few months of self-teaching from sites around the internet, I took the plunge
      into the Full-Stack Development program at Flatiron School. Each day at Flatiron led me on a
      journey to learn smarter, express myself creatively, and form tight bonds with my fellow
      students.

      Nowadays I&#39;m either polishing up on my Angular knowledge or learning a new framework -
      most recently it&#39;s been Node & React. Currently, there is a refreshing mix of personal
      projects that I&#39;m passionate about and projects that help out businesses/individuals in
      the immediate community. It is unexplicably rewarding to use the skills I&#39;ve acquired at
      Flatiron and afterward to make a positive impact in the world.

      When I&#39;m not coding, I am usually riding my bike - either on casual trips or in organized
      tours. If it is Saturday or Sunday morning, chances are you&#39;ll find me volunteering
      somewhere around town.
