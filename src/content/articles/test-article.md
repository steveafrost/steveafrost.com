# Test Article

This is a test article for our new Astro website. In a real implementation, you would migrate all the markdown files from `src/pages/articles/` to this location.

## How to Migrate Articles

1. Copy the content
2. Update frontmatter as needed
3. Fix any image paths
4. Test the display

When migrating the real articles, you'd need to:

1. Move all files from `src/pages/articles/*.md` to `src/content/articles/`
2. Ensure date formats are compatible
3. Check for any Gatsby-specific code that needs updating
