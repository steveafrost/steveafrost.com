You’d think they just started the business but believe it or not, the more popular drag-and-drop site builders got their start <a href=\\\"https://www.squarespace.com/about/company/\\\">as early as 2004</a>. I didn’t believe it.

WordPress is also 27% of the total web right now which means there is a tremendous community around it.

After making several sites of varying use from WordPress, I found the latest trend of static website generators very liberating. It is almost full circle from how websites were originally created - a group of HTML files, a group of CSS files, and maybe a JS file if the site was gettin’ fancy. These generators take that idea one step further and usually incorporate some type of <a href=\\\"https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/\\\">front-matter</a>, loops, and other intricacies <a href=\\\"http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/topics/better_views/erb_and_haml.html\\\">provided by a templating language</a>.
