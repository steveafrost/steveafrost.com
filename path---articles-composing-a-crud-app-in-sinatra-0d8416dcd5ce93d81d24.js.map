To understand this one, take a quick read at the summary of my web app from <a href=\\\"https://github.com/steveafrost/much-free-very-wow\\\">GitHub</a>.</p>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Much Free, Very Wow is a CRUD Sinatra app where users can signup, login, and contribute free activities to do in NYC.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Both users and activities are saved into a SQLite3 database upon creation.\\nActivity details can be viewed at the their RESTful URL. For example, if an activity named “Free Comedy Show” is created, the details can be viewed at /activities/free-comedy-show.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<blockquote>\\n<p>Activities can also be edited or deleted but only by the user who created the activity.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<p>Onto my dilemma. When creating activities, I wanted to include a category so that users would know if they were viewing an activity concerning music, food, art, etc. For a couple hours I weighed on whether this category should be part of the Activities table &#x26; model or if it should be it’s own table &#x26; model. I asked instructors, I asked other students, and I argued with myself in a frustrating fashion. In the end, it made the most sense to go with categories as part of the existing Activities table &#x26; model for a few reasons. First, if the category was on it’s own, I would have to query a whole additional table each time I wanted to display those categories which I predicted would be a frequent action. If the category was out on it’s own for each of these queries, I would be increasing the load times by 33%, theoretically. The benefit to having categories on it’s own would be that I could have attributes and methods specific to categories, but I didn’t need that! The choice was practically made for me.</p>\\n<p></p>\\n<p>One of the choices that had countless options was the selection of a gem for displaying messages to the user when they ran into failures. These failures happen when a user is not logged in and they try to modify activity, they’re logged in and they’re trying to modify an activity that’s not theirs, when fields are left blank during signup or login, and when the user successfully logs out. Two of the standout options for this behavior were rack-flash and sinatra-flash. From what I’ve read, sinatra-flash is an extension of rack-flash including the ability to use <em>&#x3C;%= styled_flash %></em> which will rotate through flash messages depending on what is active at the time. It also enables styling flash messages by using only one CSS rule — incredibly easy.</p>\\n<p>Once I read through the above guide and implemented flash messages for all failures, I only had a few typos and tweaks to apply and my very first CRUD app was built! Each project it becomes clearer that starting is the hardest part and each time that a roadblock comes up in the project, keep pushing and eventually it will fall. Sometimes… frequently… most often it can feel like I’m stuck at each checkpoint and cannot progress any further but then I do.
